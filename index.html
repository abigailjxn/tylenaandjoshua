Being the kind soul that she is, Ty obliged and came into the world on February 15th, 1992. Born in Kansas City and raised in Wichita, this sweet midwestern girl traded in wheat stalks for skyscrapers after graduating from the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk) and making her big move up to the Windy City! She's both down to earth and classy as they come. Her laugh can warm any heart and her beauty will make you blush. Ty majored in speech pathology, loves kids, and got involved with the Navigators during her freshman year of college. Little did she know back then that her ties to this campus ministry would lead her to meet a boy...</p>

            <h4>Matron of Honor</h4>
            <p>I met Sarah our freshman year of college but became best friends our sophomore year. We’ve had a lot of memories that I treasure over the years—like me secretly moving into Sarah’s dorm sophomore year, or driving 7 hours to go camping and leaving the first night because we were cold, going line dancing, baking on Saturday mornings. I knew early on that Sarah and I would be friends for life. By God’s grace, Sarah and I have shared many life experiences these past nine years. We had the same major, both moved to Chicago after college. We’ve dated long distance, and have also experienced the pain of being engaged long distance. She has kept me sane, gives great wisdom and has always known how to bring me back to truth.  Everyone needs a friend like Sarah. I am so grateful that God gave her to me! Don’t know where I’d be without her!

            <h4>Matron of Honor</h4>
            <p>Ashley and I met each other in high school when I was 14 (!!!!!!). We played softball together and thought she was clumsy but funny and so so so nice. It’s impossible for me to think about the past 13 years without Ashley. We became besties my sophomore year of high school and slowly but surely became family. We’ve grown up together, and have gone through high school, college, boys, moves, deaths, and adulting together. She’s opened her house, her closet, and her family to me. There’s no one that I’ve shared more beds with, texted with, prayed with, laughed with, and cried with than Ashley,  She’s one of the kindest people I know. She’s the sister I’ve always wanted that God gave me. I’m eternally grateful for her friendship!

Megan was the pitcher for our softball team, and we would frequently drive to games together. We would SCREAM Paramore and pop music. I have eaten an obscene amount of fast food with Megan. She’s carried me through my worst days and has also been there on my best. Meg has given me TOUGH love and kept me on a short leash for 13 years, which I have needed. She’s loyal and beautiful. Witty and winsome. She’s someone who I know I can depend on but also knows how to make me laugh. We don’t get to see each other often, but when we do we just pick up where we’ve left off.

Do you have that friend that is beautiful and good at everything? Me too. Mine’s Megan. She can sing, and cook and bake and she’s a Physician Assistant and she paints and she’s so smart that it isn’t fair. She is my most loyal friend and is also my hero. I look up to her (even though I’m older), and has always been a steady voice in my life that bring me back down out of the clouds. She’s usually the first person I call in a crisis, and also the person I fight the most with.  She can make me laugh in an instant and make me cry in the next. We have a deep bound for Taco Bell, boy bands, Law and Order SVU, and good clothes. Megan is one of God’s kindest gifts to me.</p>

She moved to Lawrence to join Navigator Staff at the University of Kansas in 2014, and we became best friends soon after. Ken and I are CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. We have the same personality, she’s the funniest person I know. She’s FIERCELY loyal and encouraging. She makes me feel known and that it's okay to be weird and to be me. When we’re together only shannigans and fun ensue. She’s my best friend that pour out my guts sometimes but I also need to scream sing backstreet boys. Never have I been more grateful for a friend who gets me.

We could NOT be more opposite!!!! The first time we met I thought she hated me. (lol) But we became friends shortly after that. I knew Kels would be a long time friend during that summer when we would spend hours on our off time having deep, vulnerable talks about theology and sin while sipping Sonic limeades. As STP came to a close, I kinda gave Kelsie an ultimatum and bluntly asked her if she was gonna be friends with me for life and if not, she could just lose my number. We kinda made a pack then to be lifelong friends, and I’ve always known that she would stand beside me at my wedding. I look up to her and am just enamored with how she sees the world. Kels is a heart friend who I don’t get to see enough but still feel known always. I cherish her!

We’ve spent hours, maybe days sitting in my bed processing life together. We’ve lived together the past four years and have a unique, funny relationship that I treasure. My most memorable memory with AJ traveling to Austin to head to a fun women’s conference but then I ended up projectile vomiting (oops) on the plane and had to be medically evacuated. It was half traumatic and half funny, but there is no one that I’d rather help me wipe the vomit off my sweater in the airport than AL. She fills my bucket everyday!

My first thought meeting Abigail was “WOW she is BEAUTIFUL and so COOL.” Which is the typical response most people have while meeting Abigail. We both moved to Chicago in 2015 to work for Nav staff and have been roommates for the past four years and co-workers for the three. While working together, we were always referred to together, so much that strangers assumed we were a couple. Abigail is someone I can be my freest, weirdest self with, which is a rare gift to find in a friend. We have had many many many improv sessions in our apartment that would make sense to NOBODY else but us. She has given me the space to process my pain and soft and gentle space to heal! I wouldn’t be who I am without her!

              encouragement. I've torn up many dance floors with this brother of mine. I've never met someone who can do so

              was accepted into medical school. In our excitement and because of our size difference, I lifted him into the

            <h2>Matt Girgis</h2>
            <p>Matt prayed for me at my first Navs Bible study during my freshmen year at Vanderbilt when I didn't know
              anyone and cried like a baby. We were soon after assigned to each other as "Pledge Buddies" as we sought
              membership in BYX. He has been a gracious friend and partner in crime upon many occasions. Matt has helped me
              grow and has loved me well. His most notable accomplishment in my life has probably been converting me from
              being a Moe's man to a Chipotle loyalist.</p>

            <h2>Turi Clausell</h2>
            <p>My tallest friend who truly gives me a run for my money on the dance floor, Turi (like Curry but with a "T")
              keeps me on a short leash and is truly a gift from God. We became good friends during my sophomore and his
              senior year at Vanderbilt. I've never met a person who thinks more similarly to me and I trolled Turi for
              years always pretending to forget what "ESP" meant (Extra Sensory perception- look it up) and instead
              insisting that he and I had ESV (the English Standard Version of the Bible). This was cringe-worthy at best
              for Turi as a Neuroscience and Psychology major, but for some reason he's kept me around!</p>

            <img src="./assets/images/ted.JPG">
            <h2>Ted Moock</h2>
            <p>I still remember the day I thought to myself, "Ted and I are going to be friends for life." Like many white,
              semi-outdoorsy Christian fraternity brothers at an SEC school, it happened one night when we were chilling in
              our Enos (read: hammocks) and sharing about life- honestly you could call it pillow talk but I don't know how
              kosher that is. Ted is one of the most authentic people I have ever met, which is frankly very hard for
              someone as cool/popular as he is. He shares deeply and loves freely and is far more ratchet than you would
              anticipate. We lived together our junior year of college and he learned how to twerk from me and I almost
              learned how to harmonize from him. Almost.</p>

            <h2>Clay Myatt</h2>
            <p>Clay is probably my most sane friend. He is different from me in almost every way, but we have grow so close
              through college and beyond. Although he is much smarter than me, Clay and I studied the same thing at
              Vanderbilt and had the same part-time job on campus, so we spent a LOT of time together. I admire his
              faithfulness to the Lord and to those God has called him to love, and he has one of the better laughs you will
              ever hear. No seriously, make sure you hear him laugh at the wedding, it's all inhales, no exhales.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-card-title">Why Nashville?</h3>
        <p class="uk-text-left">Great question! We’re glad that you asked. Nashville has played a big part in our relationship. It’s where we had our first kiss, our biggest fight, and it’s where we decided that we would take the risk on each other and become boyfriend and girlfriend while living 478 miles apart. We’ve been to concerts and parties here, cooked meals and gone on long walks, explored and rested. It is a city that we both love and it has loved us back.</p>
      
        <p class="uk-text-left">And practically speaking, we did it for you guys! With our main friend and family bases being in Kansas, Chicago, Nashville, and Georgia, Nashville stood out as the most central option. Our hope was to help our friends and family get to our wedding! Nashville is within driving distance for more of our loved ones than any other option we looked into. Hopefully if you made I this far, you will make it to the 615 to celebrate with us! That’s right- Nashville’s area code and our wedding date are one-in-the-same!</p>
